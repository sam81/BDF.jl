JBDF is a julia module to read BIOSEMI 24-bit BDF files.


*************************
Download and Installation
*************************

Download
========

The source code of JBDF is hosted on
github: https://github.com/sam81/JBDF

It can be installed through Julia using::

    Pkg.clone("git://github.com/sam81/JBDF.jl.git")

******
Usage
******
Load the module::

    using JBDF

To read an entire BDF recording::

    dats, evtTab, trigChan, sysCodeChan = readBdf("res1.bdf")

``dats`` is the nChannelXnSamples matrix containing the data. Note that the 
triggers are not contained in the ``dats`` matrix. The triggers can be retrieved 
either trough the event table (``evtTab``), or the raw trigger channel (``trigChan``). 
The eventTable is a dictionary containing the trigger codes ``evtTab["code"]``, 
the trigger indexes ``evtTab["idx"]`` (i.e. the sample numbers at which triggers 
occurred in the recording), and the trigger durations ``evtTab["dur"]`` (in seconds). 
The raw trigger channel returned in ``trigChan`` contains the trigger code for each recording sample. 
Additional Biosemi status codes (like cm in/out-of range, battery low/OK) are returned in ``sysCodeChan``.

You can also read only part of a recording, the following code will read the first 10 seconds of the recording::

    dats, evtTab, trigChan, statChan = ("res1.bdf", from=0, to=10) 
    

The ``readBdfHeader`` function can be used to get information on the BDF recording::

    bdfInfo = readBdfHeader("res1.bdf")


Get the duration of the recording::

    bdfInfo["duration"]

Get the sampling rate of each channel::

    bdfInfo["sampRate"]

Get the channel labels::

    bdfInfo["chanLabels"]


Beware that JBDF does not check that you have sufficient RAM to 
read all the data in a BDF file. If you try to read a file that is
too big for your hardware, your system may become slow or unresponsive.
Initially try reading only a small amount of data, and check how much
RAM that uses.
